Project Name: Temperature Prediction

Objective:
Build a model to predict temperatures using historical weather data.
Explore machine learning techniques for regression tasks.

Skills Demonstrated:
Data cleaning and preprocessing.
Feature engineering for time series data.
Implementing machine learning models for prediction.
Evaluating model performance using metrics such as RMSE or MAE.

Technologies Used:
Python
Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data analysis and visualization.

Workflow:
Load and explore the dataset.
Preprocess the data (handle missing values, normalize/scale features, etc.).
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in temperature trends.
Build and train machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, etc.).
Evaluate the model's predictions and fine-tune parameters.
Visualize results to understand model performance.

Educational Purpose:
Designed as a guided project for learners to practice machine learning workflows.
Helps in understanding regression-based temperature prediction approaches.
